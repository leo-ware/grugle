Update: just posted on Medium about this, article [here](https://leoware.medium.com/lessons-i-learned-rebuilding-the-google-search-frontend-in-react-2e9f004aa243).

Hi, this is my attempt to rebuild the frontend of google 
search in React. It's not pixel for pixel, but I think it's 
pretty close on the stuff I got around to. So, yeah, to check
it out, clone the repo and run these commands in the root 
directory.

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Also, if you are as cynical as I am, it would cross your mind
that I could have just downloaded the actual webpage and 
pushed it up here. But, the actual page isn't an SPA, and if
you go in with Chrome developer tools you can see the 
structure is totallly different.

I did borrow some icons from the original site. If you are
from Google please don't sue me.
